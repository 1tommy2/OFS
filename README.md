### How to build ( for people who want to contribute or fork )
1. clone the repository
2. run `git submodule update --init --recursive`
3. Run cmake and compile ( on windows just use visual studio 2019 with cmake support )
4. On Linux you'll need pkg-config & libmpv installed


### Windows libmpv binaries used
Currently using: [mpv-dev-x86_64-20200816-git-7f67c52.7z (it's part of the repository)](https://sourceforge.net/projects/mpv-player-windows/files/libmpv/)
